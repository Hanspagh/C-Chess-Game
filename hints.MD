#Hints on making a move

* The view should be responsible for interpreting the input
* Input could be on the form of A1-A2
* The view should translate the input to move eg. 1,1 - 1,2 and then forward this to the game controller
* The game controller should make the actual move on the game board
* Later we add move validation and piece removal
